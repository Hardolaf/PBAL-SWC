2. Installation
This software requires a webserver which is compatible with Apache2.2 or greater, MySQL 5 or greater, and PHP5.3. This software has not been tested with PHP5.4.

Provided is a sample index.php page that can access the various functions on the backend. It exists as an example only, please do not base your website on it, it may not work as expected.

Copy the contents of the 'lib' folder to your website's include path.

On all pages making calls to these functions, you will need to include the 'path.php' file located in 'lib'.

3. Use
To make a call to the Star Wars Combine Server use the following form:
	$request = new RestRequest($name, $verb = 'GET', $version=WEB_API_CONFIG_VERSION, array $requestBody = array(), $server=WEB_API_CONFIG_SERVER, $url = null);
		The variables are defined as follows:
			$name: the name of the resource being requested according the SWCombine Web API documentation.
			$verb: GET, PUT, or POST. Default 'GET'
			$version: the version of the call to make. Only use supported versions. Default WEB_API_CONFIG_VERSION
			$requestBody: an array of the information being given to the server. Default array()
			$url: a url to the resource if it is a non-standard call or must be handled in a way that is not supported by the code. This should be a rarely used override, usually handled by the PBAL-SWC code.
	$request->execute();
		This makes the actual call to the server. Other options can be set on the $request variable before the call is made.
	$handler = new RequestHandler($request);
		This requests the proper handler for the request. These should be provided by the PBAL-SWC library.
