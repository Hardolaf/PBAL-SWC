This is a technology demo of NewsBine, a sample <a href="http://www.swcombine.com">Star Wars Combine</a> web service.
<br />
<br />
The source code for the libraries of this site will be released with full OAuth2.0 support as well as sample handlers and helpers for GNS and Sim News services. Included will be a database abstraction layer and a sample autoloader, both which should be heavily customized.
<br />
<br />
All other NewsBine libraries are reserved.
<br />
<br />
Currently, the released version of NewsBine is v0.1 and is only available to members of the Star Wars Combine Web Service Beta Program. Access to v0.2 will be given to them upon completion. Publication of these samples will occur at the sole discretion of Joseph 'Hardolaf' Warner and the Star Wars Combine administration.
